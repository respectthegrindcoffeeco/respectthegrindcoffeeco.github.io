# Overview
Green Engine Coffee is a super cute, super comfortable coffee shop.  It reminds me a of a store you'd see in a Hallmark movie.  While I haven't tried any of the food (yet), the coffee is top notch.  I always make an effort to grab a cup when I'm in town.  It's definitely worth a stop if you're in the area.

## Overall Recommendation

*Green Engine is a really cute little coffee shop with cold brew that knocks you off your feet -- in the best way possible.*

<h2>Coffee  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 5;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

5 out of 5 for the cold brew.  One of my absolute favorites.  It's strong, fruity, and a bit acidic.  Just how I like it.


<h2>Aesthetic  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 2 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Cute, homey feel.  It has comfortable chairs, reading nooks, and a warm fireplace.

<h2>Food and Pastries  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 0;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

I haven't tried any of the food yet, but the pastries and ice cream look very tasty.


<h2>Vibes  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Very comfortable.  A good place to study, work, or meet up with friends.
