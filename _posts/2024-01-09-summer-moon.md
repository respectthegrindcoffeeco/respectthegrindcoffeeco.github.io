# Overview
Given that Summer Moon is a coffee chain originating out of Austin, the coffee capital of the southwest, I had really high hopes.  Sadly, my expectations were not met.  There were no exciting food options and the cold brew had a really dark flavor which just wasn't for me.  The best part about this coffee shop is the merch.  I'm a sucker for this style and you best believe I walked out with a t-shirt.

# Ratings

## Overall Recommendation

*It's a chain.  Do with that what you will.*

<h2>Coffee  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 2;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

2 out of 5 for the cold brew.  The iced lattes were too milky.


<h2>Aesthetic  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 2 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Very much what I'd call mid-western modern.  There's probably a real name for this.  Good merchandise.

<h2>Food and Pastries  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 2;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Everything I tried reminded me of day old Walmart pastries.


<h2>Vibes  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>
The vibes were fine, but it very much felt like a chain.  Definitely a better feel than a Starbucks, but you know what you're getting.
