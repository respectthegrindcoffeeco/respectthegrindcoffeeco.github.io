# Overview

To be fair, I don't remember a lot from my visit to Greenstreet.  It was fast and furious (ie. jumped out of the car in the middle of a busy Philadelphia street to run in and out).  However, I remember the shop being very small, quaint, and packing seriously good cold brew.  Combine that with friendly service and we get a coffee shop that I can't wait to revist.

## Overall Recommendation

*The cold brew was really good and the barista was friendly.  I can't wait to find my way back.*

<h2>Coffee  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

4 out of 5 for the cold brew.


<h2>Aesthetic  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 2 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Small, city industrial, primarily a roastery.

<h2>Food and Pastries  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 0;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

I didn't try any of the food.


<h2>Vibes  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

A great place to grab a coffee if you're in the city.
