# Overview
Red Bird is a cute local coffee shop that reminds me of a Hallmark movie.  The actual stores looks like a house, and the vibes match with a homey feel.  The best part about Red Bird - the coffee is good.


# Ratings

## Overall Recommendation

*Comfortable local coffee shop.  I recommend the cold brew or a latte and a side of waffles.*

<h2>Coffee  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

3 out of 5 for the cold brew.  It's pretty decent, but not the best I've had.


<h2>Aesthetic  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Looks like I'm hagning out in someone's home.

<h2>Food and Pastries  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

The food here is pretty good.  I recommend the waffles.


<h2>Vibes  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

A real community oriented place.  You'll see people from all walks of life here.
