# Overview
We stopped at Ironclad for a rest stop on a trip from Florida to Pennsylvania.  We had really high hopes given its excellent ratings on the inter-webs.  However, I personally, was extremely dissapointed with the coffee.  The shop is found in a pretty cool industrial style building. Overall, the vibes were good for studying or hanging with friends, but I wouldn't go out of my way if I was in desparate need of a good beverage.


# Ratings

## Overall Recommendation

*A good spot for hanging out.*

<h2>Coffee  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 2;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 2 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

2 out of 5.  I wouldn't order the cold brew.


<h2>Aesthetic  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Industrial but comfortable.  We sat on the outdoor patio.  

<h2>Food and Pastries  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 0;" aria-label="We didn't give this category a rating.">   </div></h2>

We didn't order any snacks.


<h2>Vibes  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

A good place to study, hang with friends, or meet your realtor. The vibes were there, the coffee was not.
