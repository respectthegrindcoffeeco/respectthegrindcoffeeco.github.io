# Overview
Let's settle this.  I know La Colombe is a chain.  But I love it.  I physically HAVE TO go to when I'm near.  It's Philly's favorite coffee (Okay -- That might be Wawa -- It's debatable).


# Ratings

## Overall Recommendation

*La Colombe has a plethora of amazing options that are sure to suit any thirsty patron.  The cold brew is good, the pastries are on point, and I would be remiss if I failed to mention the draft lattes.*

<h2>Coffee  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>
 La Colombe is about the only place that I will get coffee with milk.  The black and tan with oat milk just hits different.  I also recommend the cold brew or a hand pour over.


<h2>Aesthetic  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

I'm strictly referring to the Bryn Mawr location here, but the style is pretty industrial.  

<h2>Food and Pastries  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

They have a variety of fresh pastries.  I like a good danish or tart.


<h2>Vibes  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

A good place to sit and talk with friends or family.
