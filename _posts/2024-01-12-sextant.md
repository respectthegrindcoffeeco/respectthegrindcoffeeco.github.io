# Overview

## Overall Recommendation

*Kind of a cute little spot. The coffee isn't great.  It's on a fun little shopping strip with quaint, local stores (I really like Out There Outfitters).*

<h2>Coffee  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

2 out of 5 for the cold brew.


<h2>Aesthetic  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 2;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 2 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Very eclectic.

<h2>Food and Pastries  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

The scones get a 4.  Every flavor is a win.  My favorite is curry lime.  The muffins are dense.


<h2>Vibes  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

A good place to enjoy the outdoors.
