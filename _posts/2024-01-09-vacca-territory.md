# Overview
Vacca Territory is a cool, kinda funky local coffee shop.  I'm not exactly sure how I'd describe it.  It's warm with a midwestern feel.  The coffee and pastries are alright, but the atmosphere and ice cream make it work a visit.

# Ratings

## Overall Recommendation

*Worth a stop if you're out running errands or meeting up with a friend.  Enjoy a cinammon roll or an affogato.*

<h2>Coffee  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

3 out of 5 for the drip.  It's pretty average.


<h2>Aesthetic  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 2 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Kind of a funky, warm, midwestern transitional feel?

<h2>Food and Pastries  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

The food is pretty average, but the real star is the ice cream.  Get a scoop with espresso or a sandwiched between two cookies. 


<h2>Vibes  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Comfortable.  A good place to work, study, or meet up with friends.
