# Overview
The Gryphon Cafe in Wayne, PA is located in the middle of a really cute shopping area.  It might be worth stopping for a sip if you are out perusing, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.  In fact, I think you'd be better off going to La Colombe.  The surrounding area is definitely worth checking out though.

## Overall Recommendation

*Kind of a cute little spot. The coffee isn't great.  It's on a fun little shopping strip with quaint, local stores (I really like Out There Outfitters).  I think you'er better off stopping at La Colombe before perusing the shops.*

<h2>Coffee  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 1;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

The cold brew was not good.  We also ordered some sort of maple latte that tasted like milk and syrup.  Very disappointing.


<h2>Aesthetic  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 2;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 2 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

A little cramped.  There is a cool, quiet upstairs section that feels a little bit like being in an attic.

<h2>Food and Pastries  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 2;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

The muffin we had was decent, but nothing to write home about.


<h2>Vibes  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 2;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

The day I went to Gryphon, it was very crowded... mostly with high school students?
