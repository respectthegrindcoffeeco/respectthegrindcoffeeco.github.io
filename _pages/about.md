## About

Welcome to **Respect the Grind!**  My name is Connor.  I love coffee -- probably more than the average person.  It's a dream of mine to one day own a coffee shop.  Until then, I'm pouring hot takes on shops I come across. 

On this blog, you'll find simple reviews rating coffee locales under a few basic criteria. I hope this helps you on your journey to caffeination.
