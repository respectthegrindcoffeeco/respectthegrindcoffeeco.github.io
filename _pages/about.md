## About

Welcome to **Respect the Grind!**  My name is Connor McCurley.  I love coffee.  Probably more than the average person.  It's a dream of mine to one day own a coffee shop.  Until then, I'm pouring you some hot takes on shops I come across in my travels. 

This is how it works. I go to a coffee shop.  I drink.  I enjoy... maybe.  I go to my computer.  I write a no-frills review -- okay, maybe a few frills.  You read.  You take my advice, or you don't.  Who knows.  Probably you.

That's it!  On my blog, you'll find simple reviews rating shops under a few basic criteria. I hope this helps you on your journey to caffeination.
