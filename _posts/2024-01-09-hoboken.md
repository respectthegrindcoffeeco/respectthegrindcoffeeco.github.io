# Overview
Hoboken has been, and always will, be one of my favorite coffee shops.  I truly think it's the place where I fell in love with coffee. While I was in college at Oklahoma State, it was about the half-way point for meeting my girlfriend at the time -- obviously I made a lot of visits.  The shop was originally a car garage (it didn't even have plumbing when the owners bought it!), and much of that industrial asthetic can still be seen in the now warm and inviting interior.  The vibes are such that you can plant yourself for hours, knocking out work while sipping a fresh brew, eating warm, homemade granola, and listening to a spinning vinyl.

## Overall Recommendation

*Although it's a little off the beaten path, it's well worth a detour to grab a drip and some fresh granola.*

<h2>Coffee  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 5 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

5 out of 5 for the drip.  It's superbly strong and the variety rotates.


<h2>Aesthetic  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Industrial but warm and cozy.  

<h2>Food and Pastries  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

The homemade granola is amazing.  Get it with yogurt or milk.  The scones are also on-point.


<h2>Vibes  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

A great place for studying or meeting up with friends.
