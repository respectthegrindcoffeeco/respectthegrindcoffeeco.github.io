# Overview
I stopped at Pour Richard's during the Pandemic.  So, unfortunately, I didn't get the full experience.  The cold brew was decent, but the overall experience was pretty unremarkable.

# Ratings

## Overall Recommendation

*It's fine, but remindeds me of a bland java house.*

<h2>Coffee  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

3 out of 5 for the cold brew.


<h2>Aesthetic  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 2;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 2 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Kind of reminds me of a scarcely outfitted 90's java house.

<h2>Food and Pastries  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 0;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 0 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Sadly, we didn't try any of the food.


<h2>Vibes  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 1;" aria-label="Rating of this category is 2 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Kind of bland.  Could definitely use some more character.
