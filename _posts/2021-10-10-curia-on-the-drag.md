# Overview

Curia on the Drag is one of my favorite coffee shops.  Between the vibes, the cold brew, and the vegan options, it's a winner in my book.  Curia is a small shop with minimal indoor seating (don't expect to work in the A/C).  However, they have plenty of outdoor options with power outlets.  The drip coffee is just okay but the cold brew is one of my favorites, anywhere.  It's like battery acid (in the best way possible).  They don't offer a pour-over (insert sad face here), but they make a mean iced tea. Pastry choices vary each day and they are all vegan!  I recommend the scones.  Curia also has a unique market on their "compound", a bar called "Dad's", and a vegan food truck.  I recommend stopping by if you like strong cold brew.

## Overall Recommendation

*I recommend if you are a fan of cold brew, loose leaf tea, or vegan pastries.*

<h2>Coffee  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this product is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

5 out of 5 for the cold brew.  Drip gets a 2.  Tea gets a 4. 


<h2>Aesthetic  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 2;" aria-label="Rating of this product is 2 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

Very eclectic.

<h2>Food and Pastries  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4;" aria-label="Rating of this product is 4 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

The scones get a 4.  Every flavor is a win.  My favorite is curry lime.  The muffins are dense.


<h2>Vibes  <div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3;" aria-label="Rating of this product is 3 out of 5.">   </div></h2>

A good place to enjoy the outdoors.
